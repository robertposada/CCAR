# CCAR

## Purpose
This is an ongoing project with [robertposada](https://github.com/robertposada) to remodel and revitalize the website of the Contra Contra Association of Realtors (CCAR) Scholarship Foundation. We are expected to provide a much more dynamic and aesthetic feel to the site, as well as creating an online application and accompanying database that collects the data.

Since starting the project, we have certainly become much more skilled at **HTML** and **CSS**, but we haven't stopped there. Of course, **Javascript** has come in handy along with **PHP** and **MySQL** to handle the application form data.

## Tasks
- [ ] Finish styling site pages
- [ ] Give the site a "dynamic" feel
- [ ] Finish the application form and connect it to MySQL database
